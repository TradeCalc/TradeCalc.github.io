    I’ve been fascinated by Crypto since 2011 and actively trading in this space since 2017. When I started to focus seriously on my trading, I quickly realised that I needed to automate the calculation of my position sizes to quickly and accurately manage my risk and track my progress.
<br>
<br>In 2018 I created my first excel spreadsheet trade calculator. It was very useful and quickly became popular; over the years, it moved to google sheets, but as I continued to extend it, I hit the limitations of the format.
<br>
<br>This year I have decided to productise my calculator fully as a web app. This allows me the flexibility in design and function to enable it to grow to its full potential.
<br>
<br>I've started this blog to allow me to share some of the lessons I've about trading over the years as well as keep you up to date on the website's development. 
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>
