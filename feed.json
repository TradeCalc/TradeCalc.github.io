When I started to focus seriously on my trading, I quickly realised that I needed to automate the calculation of my position sizes to quickly and accurately manage my risk and track my progress. \n<br>\n<br>In 2018 I created my first excel spreadsheet trade calculator. It was very useful and quickly became popular; over the years, it moved to google sheets, but as I continued to extend it, I hit the limitations of the format.\n<br>\n<br>This year I have decided to productise my calculator fully as a web app. This allows me the flexibility in design and function to enable it to grow to its full potential. \n<br>\n<br>I've started this blog to allow me to share some of the lessons I've about trading over the years as well as keep you up to date on the website's development.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Regards,\n<br>\n<br>Matt Harvey<br>TradeCalc.au&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--full\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://tradecalc.github.io/media/posts/1/TradeCalc-Genesis-V4-Excel-2.jpg\" height=\"577\" width=\"677\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://tradecalc.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/TradeCalc-Genesis-V4-Excel-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://tradecalc.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/TradeCalc-Genesis-V4-Excel-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://tradecalc.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/TradeCalc-Genesis-V4-Excel-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://tradecalc.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/TradeCalc-Genesis-V4-Excel-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://tradecalc.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/TradeCalc-Genesis-V4-Excel-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://tradecalc.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/TradeCalc-Genesis-V4-Excel-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\">\n      <figcaption>Original Excel based Trade Calculator</figcaption>\n    </figure>",
